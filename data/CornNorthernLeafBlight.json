    "Description": "Northern Leaf Blight is a fungal disease that affects corn plants, caused by the pathogen Exserohilum turcicum. It is commonly found in cooler regions of the world, such as the United States, Europe, and Asia. Symptoms of Northern Leaf Blight include gray-green to tan lesions on the leaves, which may expand up to a foot in length. Severely infected leaves may die prematurely, which can result in yield losses if the disease spreads rapidly throughout the field.",
