    "Description": "Northern leaf blight is a fungal disease that affects corn plants. It is caused by the fungus Setosphaeria turcica and can cause significant yield losses if not managed properly. The symptoms of northern leaf blight include long, elliptical lesions on the leaves that are gray-green in color with irregular edges. As the disease progresses, the lesions can become larger and more numerous, eventually causing significant damage to the leaves and reducing photosynthesis. In severe cases, the disease can also affect the ears and kernels of the corn.",
