    "Description": "Black rot is a fungal disease that affects apple trees, caused by the fungus Botryosphaeria obtusa. The disease is characterized by the development of dark brown to black, sunken lesions on the fruit, which may become covered with small, black dots known as pycnidia.",
    "Treatments": [
        {
            "Prune affected branches": "Cut out the infected branches as soon as possible and dispose of them far away from the orchard. This helps to stop the spread of the disease."
        },
        {
            "Keep the orchard clean": "Regularly remove and destroy any infected fruits and leaves from the orchard. This helps to reduce the source of inoculum for future infections."
        },
        {
            "Promote good tree health": "Healthy trees are less susceptible to black rot. Ensure that the trees are properly pruned, receive adequate water and nutrients, and are not overcrowded."
        },
        {
            "Practice crop rotation": "Avoid planting apple trees in the same location as previous crops. This helps to reduce the chance of fungal spores surviving in the soil."
        },
        {
            "Use fungicides": "Fungicides such as captan or myclobutanil can help control black rot. Spray the fungicide on the tree at least two times during the growing season: once during the bloom period and again just after the petals fall."
