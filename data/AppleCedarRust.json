{
    "Name": "Apple Cedar Rust",
    "isDisease": "true",
    "Description": "Cedar rust is a fungal disease that affects apple trees, caused by the fungus Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae. The disease is characterized by orange spots on the leaves and fruit of the tree. These spots may turn brown as the disease progresses, and can cause the leaves to drop prematurely. Cedar rust can also cause damage to the bark and wood of the tree.",
    "Treatments": [
        {
            "Prune affected branches": "Cut out the infected branches as soon as possible and dispose of them far away from the orchard. This helps to stop the spread of the disease."
        },
        {
            "Remove alternate hosts": "Cedar rust requires both an apple host and an alternate host, such as a juniper or cedar tree. Removing the alternate host trees from the area can help to prevent cedar rust from developing in the first place."
        },
        {
            "Promote good tree health": "Healthy trees are less susceptible to black rot. Ensure that the trees are properly pruned, receive adequate water and nutrients, and are not overcrowded."
        },
        {
            "Practice crop rotation": "Avoid planting apple trees in the same location as previous crops. This helps to reduce the chance of fungal spores surviving in the soil."
        },
        {
            "Use fungicides": "Fungicides such as myclobutanil, propiconazole or mancozeb can help control cedar rust. Spray the fungicide on the tree in the spring, just before the tree begins to bloom."
        }

    "Products": [
        {
            "Propiconazole": "A broad-spectrum fungicide that can be effective against cedar rust."
        },
        {
            "Myclobutanil": "A systemic fungicide that provides longer-lasting protection against fungal diseases."
        },

            "Mancozeb": "A contact fungicide that works by preventing spores from germinating and infecting the tree."
