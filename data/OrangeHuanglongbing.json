    "Description": "Orange Huanglongbing (HLB), also known as citrus greening disease, is a bacterial disease that affects citrus trees, including oranges, lemons, and grapefruits. It is caused by the bacterium Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus, which is spread by the Asian citrus psyllid insect. The symptoms of Orange Huanglongbing include yellowing of the leaves, premature drop of fruit, misshapen fruit, and a decline in the overall health of the tree. The disease can be fatal to citrus trees and can lead to significant economic losses for citrus growers. Unfortunately, there is currently no known cure for Orange Huanglongbing, and infected trees usually die within a few years.",
