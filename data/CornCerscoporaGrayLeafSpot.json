    "Description": "Cercospora leaf spot, also known as gray leaf spot, is a fungal disease that affects corn plants. It is caused by the fungus Cercospora zeae-maydis and can cause significant yield losses if not managed properly. The symptoms of gray leaf spot begin as small, circular or oval, grayish lesions on the leaves, which can enlarge and merge together as the disease progresses. The lesions may have a yellow halo around them, and the leaves can eventually turn brown and die. The disease can also affect the husks and stalks of the plant.",
