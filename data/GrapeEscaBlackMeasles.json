    "Description": "Grape Esca, also known as Black Measles, is a fungal disease that affects grapevines. The disease is caused by a complex of fungi that colonize the wood of the vine, and it can result in significant crop losses if left untreated. The symptoms of Grape Esca Black Measles include the appearance of black or brown streaks on the leaves, stems, and woody parts of the grapevine. These streaks are caused by the fungi colonizing and clogging the water-conducting tissues of the vine, which can eventually lead to the death of the entire vine. Unfortunately, there is no known cure for Grape Esca Black Measles once a plant is infected.",

            "Plant resistant varieties": "Some grapevine varieties are more resistant to Grape Esca Black Measles than others, so it is important to choose a variety that is well-suited to the growing conditions in your region."

        {
            "Pruning infected wood": "Removing the diseased wood from the vine can help slow the progression of the disease and prevent it from spreading to other parts of the vine."

            "Use fungicides": "While there are no fungicides that can completely control Grape Esca Black Measles, some fungicides may be effective in reducing the severity of the disease when used in combination with other management practices."

            "Triazole": "Triazole fungicides, such as tebuconazole and propiconazole, may be effective in reducing the severity of Grape Esca Black Measles when applied preventatively. These fungicides are systemic, meaning they are absorbed into the plant and can provide longer-lasting protection."
