    "Description": "Grape black rot is a fungal disease that affects grapevines. The disease is caused by the fungus Guignardia bidwellii and can cause significant damage to fruit clusters and leaves if left untreated. The symptoms of grape black rot include small, circular spots on leaves and stems that gradually enlarge and turn brown or black. As the disease progresses, the affected tissue becomes dry and brittle, eventually causing leaves to wither and fall off. Infected fruit clusters will also develop circular, sunken spots that can turn dark and shrivel up. In severe cases, the entire fruit cluster may be destroyed.",
