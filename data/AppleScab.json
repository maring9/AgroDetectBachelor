    "Description": "Apple scab is a fungal disease that affects apple trees, caused by the fungus Venturia inaequalis. The disease is characterized by olive-green to brown spots on the leaves and fruit of the tree. As the disease progresses, the spots may become larger and darker, and the leaves may become deformed or drop prematurely. Apple scab can also cause damage to the bark and wood of the tree.",
    "Treatments": [
        {
            "Remove fallen leaves": "Apple scab spores can overwinter on fallen leaves, so it is important to remove and dispose of fallen leaves in the fall or early spring."
        },
        {
            "Use fungicides": "Fungicides such as myclobutanil, captan, or mancozeb can help control apple scab. Spray the fungicide on the tree in the early spring before the tree blooms and then repeat the application every 7 to 14 days, depending on the product used and the severity of the infection."
        },
        {
            "Promote good tree health": "Healthy trees are less susceptible to apple scab. Ensure that the trees are properly pruned, receive adequate water and nutrients, and are not overcrowded."
        },
        {
            "Practice crop rotation": "Avoid planting apple trees in the same location as previous crops. This helps to reduce the chance of fungal spores surviving in the soil."
        }
